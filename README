REQUIREMENTS:

	Java 1.4.2 or higher (1.5.0 has the nice 'Ocean' Swing interface) http://java.sun.com/
	GraphViz v2.2 or higher (uses the neato tool) http://www.graphviz.org/

RUNNING:
	
This program finds the NEATO executable file by looking in your environment
for the variable NEATO which should point to the NEATO executable.  If you
are using a linux or unix computer you can find it by executing the following
command:

	'whereis neato' (or 'which neato')

Once you know where it is the following command will add the NEATO varible to your
environment:

	'export NEATO=/usr/bin/neato' (replaced with the location of your neato tool)

(The commands may vary on a system by system basis, check the documentation which came with your OS
if you are having problems.)

The program can then be started in the following ways:

	Cd to the directory containing the extracted files.

Then:

	Executing the supplied script 'start'; './start'
	Or, 'java -jar -Dneato=$NEATO GraphGUI.jar'

There are several example graph definition files in the 'examples/' directory under the directory
containing the extracted files.

SOURCE CODE:

The Java source for this program can be found in the 'src/' directory under the directory
containing the extracted files.  It can be compiled by executing the following command:

	'javac *.java'
